List of heuristics:
- BasicCachingReverser: use heapwalker to organise heap user allocations chunks into raw records.
- AbstractReverser: Abtract controller
- FieldReverser: basic types on fields
- TextFieldCorrection: correction for text fields
- PointerFieldReverser: pointer type metadata enrichment
- KnownRecordTypeReverser: Apply Haystack search API
- DoubleLinkedListReverser: identify records type with double link list
- PointerGraphReverser: Create graph of records using pointer as edges
- ArrayFieldsReverser: TODO
- InlineRecordReverser: TODO (sub record type)
- TypeReverser: TODO compare records signatures to match types.
- CommonTypeReverser: Used by x2LinkedReverser to determine best types from a list of similar record
- WriteRecordToFile: TODO save to file

FIX the predecessors search. Most strings pointer in example are starting non-aligned <address> + 1.
Because the size is on <address>
But it doesn't seem like the POinterEnumerator checks for that :??
Check for 0xc329f8/0xc329f9 . present in memap 0xc30000
It seems the PointerEnumerator does not work. ???
And maybe we need to reverse the aligned check on DSA FieldReverser, or create an advanced one.
-> definitively an solution. but what does it break ?

1) integrate pattern and signature modules in the reverse API
2) add a Reverser that takes and search for known records types. - Done

# apply librairies structures/know structures search against heap before running anything else.
# that should cut our reverse time way down
# prioritize search per reverse struct size. limit to big struct and their graph.
# then make a Named/Anonymous Struct out of them

# The controller/Reverser should keep structs coherency. and appli maker to each of them
# the controller can have different heuristics to apply to struct :
# * aggregates: char[][], buffers
# * type definition: substructs, final reverse type step, c++ objects,

# on each integer array, look indices for \x00
# if there is a regular interval between \x00 in the sequence ( 5 char
# then 0 ) then make some sub arrays, nul terminated

# magic len approach on untyped bytearrays or array of int. - TRY TO ALIGN ON 2**x
# if len(fields[i:i+n]) == 4096 // ou un exposant de 2 > 63 # m = math.modf(math.log( l, 2)) %% m[0] == 0.0 && m[1]>5.0
# alors on a un buffer de taille l
# fields[i:i+n] ne devrait contenir que du zeroes, untyped et int




- use coroutine/threadify the StructureAnalyzer

# TODO look for VFT and malloc metadata ?
# se stdc++ to unmangle c++
# vivisect ?
# TODO 1: make an interactive thread on that anon_struct and a struct Comparator to find similar struct.
#         that is a first step towards structure identification && naming. + caching of info
# create a typename for \xff * 8/16. buffer color ? array of char?


- make a TU for the DSASimple bug.use the bytes from that record and create
a debug help that prints the resolution criterias for a record/field

- do we trust get_user_allocation or not ? for libc ? for winheap ? YES

- change the reversers anonymous structure to be POPO.
- we want all funcs outside of it.

- keep the original address in the Ouputters, python output.

++ we also need advanced constraints in the search API to be able to check for next_back == current
- re-correlate the is_valid methods to the record type, so that advanced code-based
validation is allowed on a record, on top of constraits
Will require a registation of specific validation functions, and probable access
to parent nodes 'validation state'.

- finder the text outputter bug. haystack refresh PEB returns different and bad results with a
constraint file. with a string output.
see field process Heap
while python outputters give a None value for the pointer, the string outputters will return the first pointer value
BAD: python /home/other/Compil/python-haystack/scripts/haystack --debug --string --dumpname /home/jal/outputs/vol/zeus.vmem.1668.dump/ refresh winxp_32_peb.struct__PEB  0x7ffde000 --validate --constraints_file winxpheap.constraints
OK: python /home/other/Compil/python-haystack/scripts/haystack --debug --string --dumpname /home/jal/outputs/vol/zeus.vmem.1668.dump/ refresh winxp_32_peb.struct__PEB  0x7ffde000 --validate

- change Levenshtein for fuzzywuzzy or similar

- following memory_handler changes, the __book cache seems to forget about some ctypes buffers.
  not cool. on make_context_for_heap.
  Function getRef deactivated. it doesnt bug anymore.
  it impacts performance _a lot_ to deactivate the cache.
  To be obseleted ?
  But output_to_python depends on it... TODO


- use PEB search to double check that we find all HEAPs in standard scenarios.

- use pycallgraph to cProfile a HEAP validation.
- make a callback profiler that profiles the graph path validation of a structure in graphical format
- using a decorator would be fun

- add a depth parameter to constraints loading on list fields.
- separate listmodel in a constraints like config file ?

- a working str() on Ctypes.loadableMembers requires no instanciated utils

- add an searcher configuration for padding value == 0 ( to be forwarded to basicmodel)
- padding value should be 0 most of the time. make it configurable/monkeypatchable

- use ASN.1 for constraints. ??

- add a hintoffset search thingy, so that one can search for a structure at a particular offset of a mmap ? maybe to complex for API

- make a listmodel method for arrays of structures, or not.


Attribute packed is not correct in ctypeslib

 - proper way to load constraints and bit-dependant modules is side by side

    # A - the caller has to load the proper bit-dependant python code,
    ctypes3 = cls.my_model.import_module("test.src.ctypes3_gen64")
    # my_model is alreadytarget dependant

    # B - then apply constraints on module.
    handler = constraints.ConstraintsConfigHandler()
    my_constraints = handler.read('test/src/ctypes3.constraints')
    results = haystack.search_record(self.memory_handler, self.ctypes3.struct_test3, my_constraints)



Todo:
 - Add a struct beautifier for the string formatting. (hex vs int)
 - easy API
 - documented example
 - Rekall plugin
 - Rekall memorymap
 - make basicmodel:loadable members work with vtypes (vol/rekall) ?
 - Check why pdfbparse reports some gaps in structs gap_in_pdb_ofs_3C (HEAP)
 - pylint ignore W0212 in profiles.
 - add PyQt4 as dependency for optional functions
 - Add to ipython
 - Make reverse work againe
